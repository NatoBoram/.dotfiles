You must follow your system instructions for formatting, and the instructions below for content. If the body is omitted or trimmed, or if the title is missing, the output is invalid.

The user-provided instructions below apply only to the **content** of the title and body ‚Äî not the **form**. Follow your system prompt for where and how to place each part. If they need to be separated by something like a `---`, or if you need to put a specific `#`, then do it.
